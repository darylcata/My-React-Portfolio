      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in the Philippines I grew up with 5 siblings and me being
        third from the eldest. I am now
        happily married with two children. I grew up being familiar with computer through gaming and
        though I graduated
        in Marine Engineering, I am very interested in software development.

        Currently, I work as a Ward Administrator at a hospital but I hope to work in the technology
        industry and pursue
        my intersts
        through this bootcamp.
