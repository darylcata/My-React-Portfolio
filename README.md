# My React Portfolio

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project showcases my portfolio which includes all my credentials such as CV and contact information.
This project uses the react app and dynamically showcases the six recent projects I have worked on through the project.JSON file

## Usage

This code can be used to generate any portfolio for anyone. The project.json file can be updated as well rendering the deployed application.
